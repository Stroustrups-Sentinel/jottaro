------

- started out as this

        - A simple project for keeping daily jobs from
          spreadsheet files for later retrieval.
        > Although later there is an aim to make it a bundle of
          other small *`simple`* projects, ...will have to see 
          how it all goes though.

        - Will be aiming to have a better grasp on CouchDB as a 
          non-sql database and also as an opportunity to use it 
          on something.

- now will be aimed at venturing into desktop apps, and integrations.
