# Jottaro ( repo previously named Projekt-Telko )
------

- A simple project for keeping daily jobs from spreadsheet files for later retrieval.
> Although later there is an aim to make it a bundle of other small *`simple`* projects, ...will have to see how it all goes though.

- Will be aiming to have a better grasp on CouchDB as a non-sql database and also as an opportunity to use it on something.
